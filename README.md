# SQL Injection Scanner üö®

## üöÄ Overview

The **SQL Injection Scanner** is a powerful tool designed to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities on websites by scanning and testing their forms. With its simple and easy-to-use interface, this tool automatically checks for potential weaknesses in web applications that could be exploited by attackers.

### üîç Key Features:
- **Form Detection**: Identifies all forms on a target website.
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Tests forms for common SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Detailed Output**: Provides a detailed report on which forms are vulnerable and which are not.
- **HTTP Methods Supported**: Supports both `GET` and `POST` request methods for form submissions.
  
This project is designed for penetration testers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers to quickly identify security holes in their web applications.

### üîß How It Works
Form Detection: The tool scans the given URL and automatically detects all available forms.

Input Field Analysis: It examines input fields (like text, password, hidden) in the forms.

SQL Injection Testing: For each form, the script submits test data with SQL injection characters (', "), and checks if the server responds with error messages typical of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Results: It outputs whether any of the forms are vulnerable to SQL injection.

### üí° Vulnerability Detection

The SQL Injection Scanner looks for specific error messages that indicate the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities, including:

SQL syntax errors: "You have an error in your SQL syntax"

MySQL-related errors: "Warning: mysql_fetch_array()"

Unterminated quotes: "Unclosed quotation mark after the character string"

If any of these are found, the scanner flags the form as vulnerable.
